Mid Combat Skills, by piketrcechillas

Usage:
- Step 1: Create Engage weapons with custom parameter {engage: true}. Preferably a blue for player and a red for enemy, but doesn't matter, you can use one for all. Enemy and player must have one of these in the inventory.
- Step 2: Create Wait weapon with custom parameter {wait: true}. Enemy and player must have this weapon too.
- Step 3: Enter {count: <number>, tempCount:0} into every unit parameters. For example, if you want Nash do 3 actions, enter {count: 3} into Nash's custom parameter

That's all. Have fun! If you like the script subscribe and donate etc. etc.
